# CSSE404 Compiler

This is a mini-Java to x86 compiler that was a quarter long project for CSSE404 at Rose-Hulman.

Some notes:
* To compile the sample code simply run the main class.

* The scripts included are to run the mini java code to get the correct output using a standard jvm, and to run the code output by our program and compare the output to the correct output.

* Only Windows is supported, and it has only been tested on Windows 10

* One of the features we did not implement was a garbage collection system, so code that is compiled using this program will have memory leaks when run.
